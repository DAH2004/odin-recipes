Greetings, I'm @DAH2004, and hi from the Odin Project!
This is a project demonstrating my current knowledge of web dev using html. 
Being that they are so widespread in my country of origin, and I also happen to like them, I decided to choose a selection of Italian recipes. 
Since this is my first project, it has helped me familarize with staging and committing changes in git with vscode. I am also now more experienceed in using some of the basic html elements I have seen, like the boilerplate, using links and images, and lists.
