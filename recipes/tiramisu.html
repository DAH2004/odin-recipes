    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <!--Ordered list of recipe steps goes here -->
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        Gather all ingredients. Bring 1 cup of water to a boil 
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
        Pour boiling water into a small bowl and stir in 1 tbsp instant espresso <br>
        coffee powder until dissolved. Set aside and allow to cool to room temperature, <br>
        30 minutes. When cool, add 2 tbsp coffee liqueur. You will use this <br/>
        mixture to soak ladyfingers for the filling.
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Step 3</strong></p> 
        Meanwhile, for the filling beat mascarpone and cream cheese in a large bowl <br/>
        with an electric mixer on medium until smooth. Beat in powdered sugar, <br/>
         remaining 1 tbsp instant espresso coffee powder, and salt until well <br/> 
        combined. Beat in vanilla and remaining 4 tbsp coffee liqueur. Cover <br>
         bowl, and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><p><strong>Step 4</strong></p> 
        For crust, combine 12 ladyfingers, almonds, and white sugar in a food processor. <br>
        Pulse to fine crumbs. Remove mixture from food processor. Stir in butter until <br/>
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Step 5</strong></p> 
        Pat crumb mixture evenly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. <br> 
        Place pan in the freezer until set, 15 minutes.</li>
        <li><p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
        Beat cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer until it forms stiff peaks.
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Step 7</strong></p> 
        Stir one fourth of the whipped cream into the filling mixture to lighten. Fold <br>
        remaining whipped cream into the filling mixture until combined.</li>
        <li><p><strong>Step 8</strong></p>
        Spread half of the filling over the crust. </li>
        <li><p><strong>Step 9</strong></p> 
        Dip remaining 12 ladyfingers, one at a time, into coffee mixture to coat, about 1 <br>
        second. They will soften quickly and break easily. Place atop the filling, breaking <br>
        to fit as needed. Spread remaining filling evenly over the ladyfingers.
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Step 10</strong></p> 
        Cover and chill in the refrigerator 6 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li><p><strong>Step 11</strong></p> 
        Dust cocoa powder generously over top of the cheesecake. Loosen sides of pan with a thin spatula. Remove sides of pan.
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Step 12</strong></p> 
        Garnish each slice with a chocolate covered espresso bean.</li>
        <li><p><strong>Step 13</strong></p>
        Profit.</li>
